Framework for Spreadsheet based Product Development

In Today's world you will hardly find anyone in Information Technology not using and learned Spreadsheet.
The reason the spreadsheets are so popular because it provides structured as well as un-structured representation of data.
The use of structured data starts form Primary School when we all learned the Multiplication Tables for numbers. I learned these Tables on Slate and Paper notbooks, nowadays Students are using NoteBooks for learning these tables.

Structured Data
----------------
The table created in spreadsheet has Rows and Columns. It has Column Headers and each value in the row and column has certain meaning and type. All values in the same column follows same type. 
The Table is a set of Rows, and each Row represent the element of that Table. In other words each Element belongs to Table and each Element has certain attributes saved under different column. I am calling this as Structured Data.

Unstructed Data
----------------
You can also save any data in Spreadsheet that is not structured. For example: a Ticket Booking form. In Ticket booking form there are no rows and columns. The information that you are filling is scattered across the form in different sections. Some sections has multiple rows, some sections has only values, multiple values for selection. In other words data is not stored in Tabular form. But it is stored as Label:Value form in different cells.
