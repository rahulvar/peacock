Framework for Spreadsheet based Product Development

In Today's world you will hardly find anyone in Information Technology not using and learned Spreadsheet.
The reason the spreadsheets are so popular because it provides structured as well as un-structured representation of data.
The use of structured data starts form Primary School when we all learned the Multiplication Tables for numbers. I learned these Tables on Slate and Paper notbooks, nowadays Students are using NoteBooks for learning these tables.

Structured Data
----------------
The table created in spreadsheet has Rows and Columns. It has Column Headers and each value in the row and column has certain meaning and type. All values in the same column follows same type. 
The Table is a set of Rows, and each Row represent the element of that Table. In other words each Element belongs to Table and each Element has certain attributes saved under different column. I am calling this as Structured Data.

Unstructed Data
----------------
You can also save any data in Spreadsheet that is not structured. For example: a Ticket Booking form. In Ticket booking form there are no rows and columns. The information that you are filling is scattered across the form in different sections. Some sections has multiple rows, some sections has only values, multiple values for selection. In other words data is not stored in Tabular form. But it is stored as Label:Value form in different cells.


Spreadsheet for Business 
-------------------------
Though today's entire Information Technology world using Relation Databases and Enterprise Resource Planning applications, the spreadsheets are playing a major role in decision making, planning, forecasting, Sales & Operations, Research & Development and many more areas.

There is no Software application in Today's world except Spreadsheet that supports Formulas to Link different cells in different locations. Formula cells are automatically gets updated when referenced cells in that Formula changes. This perticuler feature is impossible to build in relational databases easily and efficiently. Such a powerful feature that exists in Spreadsheet has real benefits while making decisions, planning, what-if analysis etc. 

Spreadsheets also provide formatting, charts, pivot tables to generate reports, import and export the external data, dashboards creation, writing custom macros, sorting, searching. All these features are available through User Interface like Ribbons, Popup Menus. This user-interface allow you to do certain minimum and certain tasks. 

Using real power of Spreadsheet features
-----------------------------------------
The real power of Spreadsheet is when you make Spreadsheet to run for your Business. You Name the Tables, You Set the Navigation to Open that table, You set Validation Rules, You set the Formatting, You Write Macros for Import and Export Data, You generate Reports and send E-mails on button clicks and many more. For a layman all these features should be setting based, no coding should be required, easy to learn, easy to change and save the customer settings, easy to repeat the task with less efforts. 

To achieve all these you need a Framework to be build to implement all these ideas.
